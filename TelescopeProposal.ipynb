    "This is the Jupyter notebook for Lab 1.  We'll break it into two main parts; a very brief introduction to computing with Python and Jupyter, as well as a section on some of the calculations to perform in Lab 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For grading purposes, only the items in the section \"Lab 1 Calculations\" will be examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful programming language that can be used in a wide array of applications. These next few tutorial examples will guide you through the basics of arithmetic using Python.  We'll do more advanced programming structures and analysis techniques in future labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly encouraged that go out on your own and learn to write programs and functions for Python by following some of the numerous coding tutorials available online. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this class, even if you have your own distribution of Python, we highly recommend using the online Jupyter notebooks on `vega` to execute your code, as it will make it much easier for the instructors to help you in debugging (since we have access to these as well). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will be interacting with Python through these Jupyter notebooks.  Jupyter is an interface to python that allows a mixture of text and python code and execution results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is made up of different cells with a mixture of input and output.  You can select a cell by clicking on it.  If you double click on the gray-shaded boxes, you can edit the cell's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we'll use cells of two different types, \"Markdown\" and \"Code,\" which in this case is Python.  Markdown is essentially text that has some formatting capability.  (You can change the type of a cell with the dropdown menu above.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To format text or execute code once you are done editing the input cell, just press SHIFT+ENTER and the cell will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it with the next code cell.  Click on it to make sure the cell is highlighted (feel free to double click to edit, though you won't need to).  Then press SHIFT+ENTER, and you should see `Hello World!` in the output."
